## Project structure 

Our main goal is to achieve better accuracy in classification.

The report is available in ***Titanic_report.pdf*** and the presentation in ***Presentation.pdf***.

Inside code folder, you can find the following files:

- ***classification.py*** - the main file with the used functions
- ***final_titanic.ipynb*** - the final version of our model presented in Jupyter Notebook
- ***titanic.ipynb*** - a more detailed analysis of the classification process
- ***testing.ipynb*** - set of tests of the classification.py file
- ***train.csv*** - the dataset used for training our model
- ***train_dataset.csv*** - output dile with the correct predicted values
- ***test_dataset.csv*** - output file with the values predicted by us
